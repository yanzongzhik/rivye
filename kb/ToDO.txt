
* refactor ratings code out from Panda.playNextSong()
	- rating a song kicks the focus back to the station list ... should that be changed / fixed?

* refactor the various dialog code into PandaGUI

* ? change XML script name to "pandora-player.xml"

* ? refactor to add all songs to PlayList for player, if possible to allow player to cache next few songs
	- then, can getSongs on 1 or less left in the playlist
