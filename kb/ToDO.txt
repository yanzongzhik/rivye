
* refactor ratings code out from Panda.playNextSong()
	- rating a song kicks the focus back to the station list ... should that be changed / fixed?

* refactor the various dialog code into PandaGUI

* ? change XML script name to "pandora-player.xml"

* ? refactor to add all songs to PlayList for player, if possible to allow player to cache next few songs
	- then, can getSongs on 1 or less left in the playlist

* ? remove "Low" quality; currently, it looks like only "mediumQuality" and "highQuality" URLs are being sent for the song lists
	- ! Pandora ONE == mediumQuality+ only -- missing 'lowQuality' in u'audioUrlMap'
	- injected debug code into pithos/pandora/pandora.py @ Song.__init__()
		print "pithos.pandora: song = %s" % d
