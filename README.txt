Pandora Radio Script for XBMC

*** I am considering this a pre-beta release for testing purposes. 
*** Much of the functionality is yet to be implemented.

This script is released freely without restrictions, but also without
warrenty as described in the file "COPYING.txt"

Usage:
	Place in xbmc scripts directory.
	Get key files (crypt_key_input.h, crypt_key_output.h) from pianobar 
		project (libpiano) and place in Pandora directory.
	Set login information in script properties (prompts on run if not set)
	Pick a station and enjoy the music :)
